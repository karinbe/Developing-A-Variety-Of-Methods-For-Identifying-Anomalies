Entropy:

Iteration 3 - Explanation:
 
The main change in this iteration probability function is changing and becoming more general, to fit any table it - all class probability function table cell the highest value in that column, which actually carried out the normalization of numerical values ​​to the table values ​​in the range 0-1.
At this stage, we calculated for each column the mean values ​​of the healthy people and the average values ​​of the sick people and calculated the shared entropy on the columns with the largest difference between them - indicating that these parameters have the greatest impact.
In addition, another change in this iseration is the classification of an anomaly - now each line with a smaller entropy value than a predetermined value will be classified as an anomaly
