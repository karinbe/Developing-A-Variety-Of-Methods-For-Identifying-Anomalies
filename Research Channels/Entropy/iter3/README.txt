Iteration 3 - Explanation:
Â 
The main change in this iteration probability function is changing and becoming more general, to fit any table it - all class probability function table cell the highest value in that column, which actually carried out the normalization of numerical values to the table values in the range 0-1.
At this stage, we calculated for each column the mean values of the normal behavior lines and the average values of the anomaly behavior lines, and calculated the shared entropy on the columns with the largest difference between them - indicating that these parameters have the greatest impact.

In addition, another change in this iseration is the classification of an anomaly - now each line with a smaller entropy value than a predetermined value will be classified as an anomaly.
