Iteration 3 - Explanation:

In this iteration we constructed our tree from training data that included data of normal behavior only, while the testing data contained the rest of the people - some of them normal behavior and some of them anomaly.

At this stage of the project, the development of this tool is not yet complete - the next iteration will deal with the calculation of quantization in a general and better way.
