Iteration 5 - Explanation:

In accordance with our development plan and based on the results of the development of the entropy method in which we used normal distribution, at this stage we implemented the normal distribution as we did here.
We calculated the mean and the standard deviation, and divided the intervals according to the interval.

This method did not complete - it is necessary to move from private case to general case, so in the next iteration we will continue to focus on quantization.
