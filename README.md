As part of the closure of the degree of the Department of Software Engineering (BS.c) in [Azrieli College of Engineering](http://www.jce.ac.il/), our final project will deal with anomaly detection.

The project will focus on developing a variety of methods for identifying anomalies and making decisions according to the majority vote on medical data.

Despite the technological developments and the various tools for responding to the problem, it is still difficult to cover comprehensive tests that will detect all the deviations that are in full force, and even when they are located to determine whether they are correct or not. In this regard, in our study we offer a deep look at the model of anomaly detection, whose goal is to maximize the solution to the problem and leveraging the chances of detecting abnormalities, anomaly.
