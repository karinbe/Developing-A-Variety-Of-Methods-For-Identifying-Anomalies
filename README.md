As part of the closure of the degree of the Department of Software Engineering (BS.c) in "Azrieli College of Engineering - Jerusalem",
our final project will deal with information security in medical systems.

The project will focus on developing a variety of methods for identifying anomalies and making decisions according to the majority vote on medical data.

In our view, the issue of information security, especially in the public health sector, is a focus of trouble on the part of hostile elements - from infiltration to privacy and theft of details to the change in the dosage of a registered drug - which is a threat to human life. Therefore it is desirable to be prepared and to know how to defend against these dangers.
